<h3>Cycling Tips </h3>
<article>
  <h2>How to start Cycling</h2>
  <p>Cycling is a fun and addicting sport. The joy of riding your bike is seeing your progress and seeing where two wheels can take you! I always suggest starting small and riding anywhere from 5-7 miles. See how you feel throughout the week riding that distance and gradually increase distance every week. Before you know it you will be a weekend warrior and ride 50+ miles! Tour de France winners are not built overnight!</p>

<h2>What type of Bike do I need?</h2>
<p>No need to break the bank on your first bike! I started with an 1960 Peagut back in Chicago, gradually got another bike for $200, and then splurged on a $800 Cannondale. Currently I own a $2,500 Canyon. But I would suggest buying a used $80-$150 road bike to start and then go for the $3,000 bike.</p>

<h2>What do you need to wear for cycling?</h2>
<p>HELMET HELMET HELMET. If you are planning on riding your bike without a helmet, get out of my site! You can wear whatever you like, you can ride naked, but you must must wear a helmet! As for clothing, once you get to ride 10 miles or more, I reccomend getting some padded cycling shorts. They make a huge difference and will make you like cycling more. I have met a bunch of people that have left the sport because their booty hurts for not wearing comfortable shorts. Tops, tees are ok! Tee shirt rides are in fashion!</p>
